    "* It might be thought that work done 30 years ago would be obsolete today. Fortunately, the work of Jeffreys, P´olya and Cox was of a fundamental, timeless character whose truth does not change and whose importance grows with time. Their perception about the nature of inference, whichwas merely curious 30 years ago, is very important in a half-dozen different areas of science today; and it will be crucially important in all areas 100 years hence.\n"
